## Wonderposts

Very simple Posts and Comments system. 
Vanilla Javascript, async await fashion and class es6 syntax.

### Requirements

We need `node` and `npm` to be installed on your machine.

### Work in progress
- Move URL API storage in a constant to be imported in the modules.
- Extract API methods to a communication module.
- Move events to each view, removing them from window using event delegation.
- Adding more documentation about decision making and architecture choices.

### Usage

1. Run npm install command to download and install all dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to run the app. This command will run the project in development mode.
3. That's it!
